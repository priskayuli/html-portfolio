<h1>Top Movies of All Time According to Yuli</h1>
<h2>My Best 3 Movies.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Wild Robot</h3>
<p>The movie teach a lot about parenting. You don't have a manual of parenting, you just try to do it.
   Sometimes you need to learn and do your research if you are going to teach your children about
   things that you also haven't learn before. You and your children make mistakes, but that's okay,
   as long as you love each other. You have to let your children go at one point.
</p>

<h3>Pay It Forward</h3>
<p>The movie teach about family's love, about teacher's love. A teacher can make a huge impact if they
   really care for the students and not merely teaching. A mom can be lost too and if a mom is not happy
   then she can't function well. A young kid can have impact to a society if he/she guided well.
   You can start a very small step of kindness and it can impact hugely if other people do the same
</p>

<h3>50 first dates</h3>
<p>A great romantic comedy that teach a sincere and pure love. You can go through anything if you
   love each other and willing to give the best for your couple.
